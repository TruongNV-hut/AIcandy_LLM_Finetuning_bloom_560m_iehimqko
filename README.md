# Fine-tuning large language models

<p align="justify">
Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) involves adapting a pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains by training it further on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process leverages the general knowledge the model has already learned during its initial training on vast and diverse datasets, allowing it to specialize efficiently. Fine-tuning can improve performance in areas like sentiment analysis, text summarization, or domain-specific applications (e.g., legal or medical texts). Techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and prompt engineering are commonly used to align the model with desired outcomes. Fine-tuning is a cost-effective way to harness the power of LLMs for targeted applications while minimizing computational overhead..
